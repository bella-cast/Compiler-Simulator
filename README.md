# Compiler-Simulator
This repository contains files that simulate the work of a scanner and a parser that occur during the compilation process. It uses MIPS instructions and WLP4, a programming language used in courses at the University of Waterloo. DFA's showing the tokens and values of the languages are given and commented out in each file.
